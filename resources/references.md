## Discussion

Hordern and Purcell quote Pliny’s *Natural History* 14.2 as one of the epigraphs for the section
that features this graph (Chapter IX Mobility of Goods and People).

> commercio rerum ac societate festae pacis omniaque, etiam quae ante occulta fuerant, in

The key observation that Horden and Purcell make in relation to Table 5.

> “One arresting feature of the shipwreck evidence is the relatively poor showing made by the

There are caveats about the nature of shipwreck evidence: in particular, changes in cargo (amphorae
give way to containers, but amphorae are more visible in archaeological record) and the potential
for differing rates of vulnerability to storms between the ancient and medieval periods.
