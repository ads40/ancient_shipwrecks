The starting point for this challenge is an often-cited graph that appears, among other places, in
Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell's well-known book about the long history of the Mediterranean,
*The Corrupting Sea* [@horden2000].

![Horden and Purcell (2000), 371](resources/horden_purcell_mediterranean_shipwrecks.png)

The graph featured by Horden and Purcell is part of a larger argument regularly made by historians
of the ancient economy that the volume of sea-borne trade in the Mediterranean was larger in the 2nd
century CE than at any other time before the 19th century.^[For discussion of this use of Parker's
graph, see @robinson_developments_2011: "His [i.e. Parker's] graph of the number of wrecks per
century (Figure 2.1) was seized on by ancient historians from Hopkins onward as a means of
illustrating fluctuations in the levels of Mediterranean maritime trade, taking the number of wrecks
in any period as a more or less straightforward reflection of the intensity of maritime shipping and
therefore trade, and has featured in numerous discussions of the Roman economy";
@justin_leidwanger_time_2017, 596: "Parker’s most famous histogram from this volume -- illustrating
the number of known shipwrecks by century -- has since been reproduced in so many contexts that it
now essentially serves as shorthand for the increase and decrease in maritime activity over the
Graeco-Roman period and, more generally, the long-term growth and decline of the ancient economy".
@callatay_graeco-roman_2005 puts the evidence of shipwrecks in the context of several other directly
quantitative approaches to the ancient economy over long periods, including lead, silver and copper
levels in sediment and ice cores.]

This argument depends upon several things:

1. The first premise is that Mediterranean commercial ship building and sailing techniques
   remained relatively consistent from at least 500 BCE until the 16th century CE.

2. The second premise is that the frequency of shipwreck-inducing events in the Mediterranean (e.g.
   storms) remained relatively consistent over the period (2500 BCE to 1500 CE).
   
3. The third, and perhaps weakest, premise is that wrecks from all periods are equally likely to be
   discovered.^[There are genuine complications here: e.g. the type of cargo makes a very big
   difference in the likelihood of an ancient shipwreck being located, and the change in storage
   containers from amphorae to barrels by the Medieval period may obscure many sites of Medieval 
   wrecks -- there is simply no mound of amphorae to be found. See @robinson_developments_2011,
   @rice_shipwreck_2016, 166-168.]

Given these premises, the number of shipwrecks might then be considered to constitute a fairly
direct index of the overall level of maritime economic activity in the Mediterranean.

So: can we recreate this graph using a more recent dataset than Horden and Purcell (who worked from 
Parker's [-@parker_ancient_1992] book on ancient shipwrecks)? Is Horden and Purcell's argument borne
out in more up-to-date evidence, especially given the explosion of shipwreck archaeology in the past
twenty years?^[See @robinson_developments_2011 for a scholarly re-assessment based on more recent 
data.]

# The Challenge

This challenge is structured in a series of steps, including obtaining the data, modifying the data
in order to support various forms of analysis, and then presenting findings in tabular and graphic
forms. These are core tasks in any form of data analysis.

For each section, there are a set of questions and tasks. Not all of these will be able to be
answered with the data in its original form.

## Get the data

Download a copy of the dataset [@strauss_shipwrecks_2013] listed below, import the data, and carry 
out the following tasks.

> Strauss, Julia. 2013. 'Shipwrecks Database'. *The Oxford Roman Economy Project*.\
> oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/shipwrecks_database/.

1. Set up a new project in RStudio for your analysis. Your project should include the following
   files and folders:
   - a `.gitignore` file for R
   - a `data_raw` directory for downloaded data sources
   - a `data_processed` directory for cleaned data ready for analysis
   For the `.gitignore` file, think about whether you want to commit the outputs of your analysis
   or not (mostly, you should not: outputs are livestock, not pets).

2. Download the data. There is zip file of the dataset, which you can find by:
   - going to the URL above;
   - scrolling to the bottom of the page;
   - finding the link embedded in the text, under the word "here".

3. Import the data into R using an R script called `munge_data.R`. Think about how the columns/
   variables are named, and what data types are imported. You may wish to modify the column names
   and/or use a `col_types =` argument (see the docs for `readr::read_csv`) to control how the data
   is imported.

4. The `munge_data.R` script should save the cleaned data into your project. Use the function
   `saveRDS()` to save the cleaned dataset as a file that can then be directly loaded into your
   analysis.

5. You can then make the initial commit in Git.

   ```
   # in the Terminal
   > git status
   > git add .
   > git commit -m "Initial commit."
   ```

5. Create a `.Rmd` file, and start to explore the dataset. Load the dataset into R (using the 
   pattern `mydataset <- readRDS("path/to/the.RDS"`) and generate an initial summary of the 
   variables in the dataset. The function `str()` is helpful.
   
   Consider these questions:
   - What does each column contain?
   - What is the range of values in each column?
   - What data is missing (consider the NA values, but also other "missing data" values e.g. 0, -1 
     etc.)?

```{r exploratory_data_analysis}

shipwrecks <- readRDS("processed_data/shipwrecks.RDS")

str(shipwrecks)

sea_area_values <- unique(shipwrecks$sea_area)

country_values <- unique(shipwrecks$country)




```


## Dates

You may have noticed that columns `date_range` and `mid_point_of_date_range` variables contain only
zeros. Data is missing here, but it is possible to calculate and fill in values for these columns
using data in other columns.

Fix this missing data.

1. Calculate the mid-point and fill the `mid_point_of_date_range` column.
2. Calculate the date range (which amounts to a measure of the uncertainty of the dating) and fill
   the `date_range` column with data. Remember that the dates include negative values (BCE).

```{r shipwrecks-dates}

date_range <- function(earliest, latest) {
  abs(latest) - abs(earliest)
}


shipwrecks_dates <- shipwrecks %>% 
  mutate(
    date_range = date_range(earliest_date, latest_date)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    mid_point_of_date_range = round((earliest_date + latest_date) / 2, 0)
  )

```

Using the updated data, answer these questions:

1.  How many shipwrecks are there in the data?
2.  What is the earliest shipwreck?
3.  What is the latest shipwreck?
4.  How many shipwrecks fall between 100 BCE and 100 CE?

```{r}
shipwrecks_dates %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    earliest = min(mid_point_of_date_range, na.rm = TRUE),
    latest = max(mid_point_of_date_range, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## Locations

1.  What countries have the shipwrecks been found in?
2.  The "countries" \``ZZ-Non-Mediterranean` and `International waters` form part of the dataset.
    Can we mine some other part of the data to supply more information? How might we go about this?
3.  How many wrecks have been discovered in each country?
4.  How many shipwrecks in the database have a location specified by a valid lat-long pair?

### What countries?

```{r}
wreck_countries <- unique(shipwrecks_dates$country)

wreck_countries
```

## Shipwrecks with valid lat-long pair?

```{r valid-lat-long-count}

shipwrecks_dates %>% 
  filter(
    !is.na(latitude) | !is.na(longitude)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    !(latitude == 0 & longitude == 0)
  ) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    earliest = min(mid_point_of_date_range, na.rm = TRUE),
    latest = max(mid_point_of_date_range, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_lat = min(latitude, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_lat = max(latitude, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_long = min(longitude, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_long = max(longitude, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```

## Main challenge

Try to recreate the graph given in Horden and Purcell (2000) as Table 5. Do the contents of the
Shipwrecks Database, with twenty more years data than Parker 1992, back up the original conclusion?

What improvements can you make to the original presentation of the graph?

```{r}

shipwrecks_dates %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = mid_point_of_date_range), binwidth = 50) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(-2000, -1500, -1000, -500, 1, 500, 1000, 1500),
    labels = c(
      "2000 BCE", "1500 BCE", "1000 BCE", "500 BCE", "1 CE", "500 CE", "1000 CE", "1500 CE"
      )
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    plot.caption = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(halign = 1, margin = ggplot2::margin(6, 0, 0, 0))
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Approximate date",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Ancient Mediterranean shipwrecks, 2200 BCE to 1500 CE",
    subtitle = paste0(
      "On the evidence of shipwrecks, the period 100 BCE to 100 CE was the greatest period of\n",
      "maritime trade in the Mediterranean until the modern era (Horden and Purcell 2000, 371-372)."
    ),
    caption = paste(
      "Data from Strauss, Julia. 2013. ‘Shipwrecks Database’.",
      "*The Oxford Roman Economy Project*.",
      "oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/shipwrecks_database/."
    )
  )


```

## Bonus challenge

1.  Plot the shipwrecks that have valid long-lat coordinates onto a map (use `ggplot` and
    `rnaturalearth` for the maps).

    -   Read the `ggplot2` in-progress book (3rd edition) about mapping:\
        <https://ggplot2-book.org/maps.html>.

    -   Use these snippets to add a map layer from `rnaturalearth`:

        -   `world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")`
        -   `ggplot(data = world) + geom_sf()`

2.  Create a faceted set of maps on some variable of your choice, e.g. date ranges.

```{r plot_shipwrecks, fig.height=8}
# get data for labelling individual countries
countries <- read_tsv("processed_data/countries.tsv") %>% 
  # only relevant countries for the shipwreck data
  filter(
    name %in% unique(shipwrecks_dates$country)
  ) %>% 
  # avoid name clash
  select(-name)
# add labelling data onto the Natural Earth countries data
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf") %>% 
  left_join(countries, by = c("iso_a2" = "country"))

shipwrecks_dates_locations <- shipwrecks_dates %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(latitude) | !is.na(longitude)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    !(latitude == 0 & longitude == 0)
  )

# make the plot
ggplot() +
  # set up the world map with NE countries data
  geom_sf(data = world, fill = "antiquewhite") +
  # layer on points for the shipwrecks
  geom_point(
    data = shipwrecks_dates_locations, aes(
      x = longitude, 
      y = latitude, 
      colour = mid_point_of_date_range,
    ), 
    alpha = 0.75, size = 3
  ) +
  # add labels for relevant countries
  geom_label(
    data = world, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, label = name), nudge_y = 0.3, size = 3
  ) +
  # crop the map to the Mediterranean
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-1, 35), ylim = c(30, 47), expand = TRUE) +
  # select an appropriate colour scale
  scale_color_viridis_b(name = "Approx.\ndate", option = "plasma") +
  # adjust the overall visual appearance
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = gray(0.5), linetype = "dashed", size = 0.5),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightsteelblue1"),
    plot.caption = ggtext::element_textbox_simple(halign = 1.01, margin = ggplot2::margin(6, 0, 0, 0))
  ) +
  # add labels for the overall map
  labs(
    title = "Ancient Mediterranean shipwrecks",
    subtitle = "358 wrecks with known location data, 1800 BCE to 1500 CE",
    caption = paste(
      "Data from Strauss, Julia. 2013. ‘Shipwrecks Database’.",
      "*The Oxford Roman Economy Project*.",
      "oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/shipwrecks_database/."
    )
  ) +
  # add direction and scale annotations from the package `ggspatial`
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", width_hint = 0.4) +
  annotation_north_arrow(
    location = "bl", 
    which_north = "true",
    pad_x = unit(1, "cm"),
    pad_y = unit(1, "cm")
  )

ggsave("output/shipwrecks_plot.png", device = png)
```
